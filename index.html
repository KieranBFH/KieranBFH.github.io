<h1>Renaming Scandal</h1>
<hr></hr>
<h3>In 2014, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin">President Vladimir Putin</a> called for a renaming and reformating of the school, despite pushback from the Belgorod school district.  After Vladimir Putin assumed leadership in Russia, Bev Facey Communist High School found itself at the center of a renaming controversy. Putin's presidency marked a period of significant political and ideological shifts, prompting a reevaluation of symbols associated with the Soviet era and communism. Under Putin's rule, there was a gradual transition towards a more conservative and nationalist agenda, distancing the country from the socialist ideologies of the past. This ideological shift influenced public discourse and raised questions about the appropriateness of educational institutions carrying communist references. Critics argued that Bev Facey Communist High School's name perpetuated a connection to an outdated ideology, which was no longer aligned with the current political climate and values. They contended that retaining the word "Communist" in the school's name conveyed an endorsement of a bygone era, contradicting the government's nationalist narrative and its vision for modern Russia. <br><br>Many factions formed, all suggesting different names for the school. <I>Italics!</I></h3>

 <h3>In 2023, an odd piece of paper was found in the school. These were its contents: <br> <br> </h3>
 <h1>Theory</h1>
 <hr></hr>
 1. The internet backbone is like the main highway of the internet. It's a super-fast network made up of cables and equipment that connects different cities and internet providers together. It helps data travel quickly between different networks and allows us to do things like browse the web, send emails, and watch videos online. It's the foundation of the internet that keeps everything connected and working smoothly.
 <br><br>   2. On the internet, clients and servers have different roles. A client is a device, like a computer or smartphone, that users use to access the internet and request information or services. It sends requests for web pages or files to servers. Servers, on the other hand, are powerful computers or systems that store and provide information or services. They receive client requests and respond by sending the requested data back to the client. In simpler terms, a client is like a user's device, and a server is a computer that provides the requested information or services.
 <br><br> 3. Servers, routers, switches, workstations, and other hardware components play vital roles in the functioning of the internet. Servers are powerful computers that store and process vast amounts of data, serving web pages, hosting applications, and handling network requests. Routers are devices responsible for directing network traffic, enabling data to flow between different networks or devices. Switches, on the other hand, connect multiple devices within a local network, allowing them to communicate with one another. Workstations are individual computers used by users to access and interact with the internet, running applications and accessing data hosted on servers. These hardware components work together in a coordinated manner, with servers hosting and processing data, routers directing the flow of information between networks, switches connecting devices in local networks, and workstations enabling users to access and utilize the internet's resources. Their collective operation enables the seamless communication and exchange of information that forms the foundation of the internet.
<br><br> 4. The Internet Protocol Suite, also known as TCP/IP, is a set of protocols that enables communication between devices over the internet. It consists of multiple layers, including the application layer, transport layer, internet layer, and network access layer. TCP/IP provides the data transfer mechanism required to establish client/server relationships by encapsulating data into packets, assigning IP addresses for identification and routing, ensuring reliable transmission through protocols like TCP, and handling addressing, routing, and delivery of packets across interconnected networks.

</ul>
<br><br> 6. Hypertext is a method of organizing and presenting information in a non-linear way, allowing users to navigate through related pieces of text or multimedia by selecting hyperlinks. It enables interconnectedness between different pieces of content, providing a non-linear and interactive browsing experience.
<br><br> 7. The web, short for World Wide Web, is a system of interconnected hypertext documents and resources that are accessed through the internet. While the internet is the global network infrastructure that connects various networks and devices, the web is an application or service that operates on top of the internet, allowing users to access and navigate web pages using web browsers.
<br><br> 8. The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a protocol used for transmitting hypertext over the internet. It facilitates client/server interaction by defining a set of rules for how a client (web browser) and a server communicate and exchange data. The client sends an HTTP request to the server, specifying the desired resource, and the server responds with an HTTP response containing the requested resource or appropriate status codes and headers.
<br><br> 9. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a protocol used for transmitting data over the internet. It operates on top of TCP/IP and is primarily designed for unencrypted communication. HTTP is not secure, meaning the data exchanged between client and server can be intercepted or modified by malicious entities. HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is a secure version of HTTP that uses encryption mechanisms, typically SSL/TLS, to establish a secure and encrypted connection between the client and server. It ensures that the data transmitted is encrypted and protected, making it much more difficult for attackers to intercept or tamper with the communication.
<br><br> 10. Web 1.0: In the Web 1.0 era, websites were predominantly static and read-only. They were designed to deliver information to users, who could only passively consume the content. Websites consisted mainly of text and images, and user interaction was limited.
<br>Web 2.0: With the advent of Web 2.0, the web became more dynamic and interactive. User-generated content and social media platforms emerged, allowing users to create, share, and interact with content. Web 2.0 emphasized user participation, collaboration, and the creation of online communities.
<br>Web 3.0: Web 3.0, also known as the Semantic Web, represents the next phase of web development. It aims to make information more meaningful and accessible to both humans and machines. Web 3.0 focuses on technologies like artificial intelligence, linked data, and the Internet of Things (IoT), enabling smarter search, personalized recommendations, and seamless integration of data from various sources.
<br><br> 11. - Web 1.0 was static and read-only, while Web 2.0 introduced dynamic and interactive features.
<br>- Web 1.0 focused on delivering information, while Web 2.0 emphasized user-generated content and social interactions.
<br>- Web 2.0 allowed users to actively participate, collaborate, and share content, while Web 1.0 had limited user interaction.
<br>- Web 3.0 aims to make information more meaningful and accessible to both humans and machines, leveraging technologies like AI, linked data, and IoT.
<br><br> 12. Markup languages provide a standardized way to structure and format content on the web. They define the syntax and rules for annotating text with tags or elements, allowing web browsers to interpret and render the content correctly. Markup languages like HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) provide the foundation for creating web pages, specifying the structure, layout, and presentation of the content.
<br><br> 13. Markup languages, such as HTML and XML, are used for structuring and formatting content on the web. They focus on describing the elements and hierarchy of the content, defining how it should be presented or interpreted.
Scripting languages, such as JavaScript, are used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. They allow for the execution of scripts or code that can manipulate the content, respond to user actions, and interact with servers or other external resources.
<br><br> 14. - Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) is a standard for defining markup languages, which served as the foundation for HTML and XML.
<br>- Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language that allows for the definition of custom tags and structured data. It is a versatile language used for representing and exchanging data.
<br>- Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the web. It defines the structure and layout of web pages, specifying how elements should be displayed.
<br>- Extensible Hypertext Markup Language (XHTML) is an XML-based version of HTML, which follows stricter rules of XML syntax and is compatible with both HTML and XML parsers.
<br>- Dynamic Hypertext Markup Language (DHTML) refers to a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create dynamic and interactive web pages.
<br>- Markdown (MD) is a lightweight markup language designed for creating formatted text using a simple syntax. It is commonly used for writing content that can be easily converted to HTML or other formats.
